### What is Django OCI?

Django-OCI is an open source registry that conforms to the opencontainers [distribution spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec). It is a Django module, meaning that Python developers that use Django can easily implement their own
OCI compliant registries.

### What is a Linux Container?

A container image is an encapsulated, portable environment that is created to distribute a scientific analysis or a general function. Containers help with reproducibility of such content as they nicely package software and data dependencies, along with libraries that are needed. Thus, the core of Singularity Hub are these Singularity container images, and by way of being on Singularity Hub they can be easily built, updated, referenced with a url for a publication, and shared. This small guide will help you to get started building your containers using Singularity Hub and your Github repositories.
